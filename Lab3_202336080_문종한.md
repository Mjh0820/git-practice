# Weather Forecasting System

> Note: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.

## Proposal

I am planning to develop a weather forecasting system that predicts weather conditions based on historical data. To achieve this, I will utilize machine learning algorithms along with libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas.

For example, the following graphs illustrate the predicted temperature trends using our model:
